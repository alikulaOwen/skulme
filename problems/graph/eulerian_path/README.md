# Eulerian Path

**Category:** `graph` | **Language Track:** Java (Interview Focus), Rust, Python, TypeScript

## Problem Statement

This module provides functionality to find an Eulerian path in a directed graph.
An Eulerian path visits every edge exactly once. The algorithm checks if an Eulerian
path exists and, if so, constructs and returns the path.

### Original Rust Signatures
```rust
pub fn find_eulerian_path(node_count: usize, edge_list: Vec<(usize, usize);
pub fn new(adjacency_list: Vec<Vec<usize>>) -> Self;
```

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

## Java Interview Strategy & Tips

- Adjacency lists are typically represented as `List<List<Integer>>` or `Map<Integer, List<Integer>>`.
- Use `computeIfAbsent(u, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(v)` for concise graph construction.
- For BFS: ALWAYS use `Queue<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>()` (never `LinkedList`, which incurs heavy node allocation overhead).
- For Dijkstra: Use `PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]))` where `a[0]` is node and `a[1]` is distance.

### Rust vs. Java Perspective
- Rust graphs often use `BTreeMap<V, BTreeMap<V, E>>` or adjacency lists with explicit vertex indexing.
- In Rust, graph traversal requires explicit borrowing or node index IDs to avoid borrow checker conflicts with circular references.
- **Reference Implementation:** Compare your Java solution with the original Rust code in [`eulerian_path.rs`](../../../src/graph/eulerian_path.rs).

## How to Spin & Run

### 1. Java (Target Interview Language)
Run directly as a single-file application with built-in tests:
```bash
java Solution.java
```

### 2. Rust (Original Ground Truth Answer)
Run the crate unit tests for this module from the repository root:
```bash
cargo test --lib graph::eulerian_path
```

### 3. Python (Rapid Prototyping)
```bash
python3 solution.py
```

### 4. TypeScript (Industry Standard)
```bash
bun solution.ts
# or using Deno:
deno run solution.ts
```

## Self-Evaluation Checklist
- [ ] Understand the problem constraints and edge cases (e.g. empty input, bounds, duplicates).
- [ ] Implement the optimal solution in `Solution.java`.
- [ ] Verify correctness using `java Solution.java`.
- [ ] Contrast time/space complexity and idiomatic differences with the Rust source in [`eulerian_path.rs`](../../../src/graph/eulerian_path.rs).
